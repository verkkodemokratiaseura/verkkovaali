Authentication process
======================

The authentication process is implemented using a dedicated OpenID provider
(https://did.fi) which handles the authentication. Other OpenID providers are
not trusted. The application also maintains a whitelist of valid OpenID
identities which are allowed to participate in the election after successful
authentication. It therefore follows that

  * only https://did.fi may act as an identity provider for this application.

  * only authenticated identities whitelisted in the application database are
    allowed to participate in the election.

During the election period (21.3.2010 - 27.3.2010) authenticated users are
granted the ``vote`` permission which permits them to cast a vote. Before and
after the configured period it is not possible to cast a vote.
