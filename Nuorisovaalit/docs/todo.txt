TODO
====

  * When we get the candidates list, verify that each candidate's election
    district has a matching record in our districts module.

  * When we get the list of users for the OpenID provider, verify that for
    each user's municipality we have a matching record in our district module.

  * Custom 404 page

  * Custom 401 page

  * Page to reject authenticated users that have already voted.

  * Because we store the profile information in a volatile storage all code
    that deals with the data must be prepared to not find it.

  * Make sure all our pages are served with caching explicitly forbidden at
    all levels.
